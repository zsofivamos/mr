## MR

This package contains three functions to work with currencies. 
-get_bitcoin_price() uses the binance_coins_prices() function from the daroczig/binancer package.
-forint() appends 'HUF' to the input value
-convert_currencies() - drumroll please - this one converts currencies. 

### Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('zsofivamos/mr')
```

This is my first ever r package website and the package is really simple. I don't really know what else to say,please enjoy this banana pancake recipe instead:

**Ingredients**
- 2 eggs
- 1 banana
- cinnamon
- vanilla 

Mash the banana with a fork and whisk in the eggs. Add cinnamon and vanilla flavor per preference. Heat a non-stick pan and spraz lightly with oil. Take a smaller cup of the mix and pour it into pan. Cook for a couple minutes then flip. Bon App√©tit!
